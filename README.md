***Welcome to a REACT NATIVE To Do app***

**WARNING**
**THIS IS A WIP AND DOES NOT HAVE FULL FUNCTIONALITY YET**

To get started:

    download node, must use atleast `version 8`, or whatever is the latest version
    
    git clone *repo name*
    
    cd into *repo name*

    npm install

    Use the xcode app, or download xcode and use the ios simulator

I prefer the simulator, so download xcode from apple

    Once xcode is installed go to the ole terminal

    npm start

This will start the react native bundler, after it's finished press i, this loads the ios simulator and voila, you have an app

If you would like to experiment with full-stack node and react-native please go to 

    https://github.com/rsbabcock/todoApi

and follow it's read me to have both api and react native running together. Have fun!
